Troubleshooting Topics
----------------------


TERAJDBC4 ERROR ... The com.ncr.teradata.TeraDriver class name is deprecated
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Teradata JDBC Driver class names are available.

   - For JDBC URL connections: com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver
   - For WebSphere Data Sources: com.teradata.jdbc.TeraConnectionPoolDataSource

The old class names will continue to work; however, a warning message
will be printed as a reminder to switch over to the new class names.

   TERAJDBC4 ERROR ... The com.ncr.teradata.TeraDriver class name is deprecated.
   Please use the com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver class name instead.

   TERAJDBC4 ERROR ... The com.ncr.teradata.TeraConnectionPoolDataSource class name is deprecated.
   Please use the com.teradata.jdbc.TeraConnectionPoolDataSource class name instead.


Solution:

Please change your applications and data source definitions at your
earliest convenience, because the old class names will only be supported
for a limited number of future releases.


Unable to connect to database when using HPUX 11.23 JDK 5.0
-----------------------------------------------------------

When attempting to connect to the Teradata Database when HPUX 11.23 JDK 5.0,
you may receive an exception similar to: TeraEncrypt: Error
tdgss-stack-trace-begin>>> GSSException: Failure unspecified at GSS-API
level (Mechanism level: Failure during key generation by algorithm layer.)

This is a known problem with HPUX 11.23 JDK 5.0. HP's web site states
the following:

 SecureRandom engine implementation (11i HP Integrity and HP9000 PA-RISC) 

  Beginning with 5.0, Sun Microsystems' SecureRandom engine implementation 
  supports a new algorithm, NativePRNG, in addition to SHA1PRNG. NativePRNG 
  will only be available if /dev/random and /dev/urandom are installed in 
  your system. Because HP-UX does not support seeding entropy generating 
  devices such as /dev/random, applications that rely on this will not be 
  able to use NativePRNG. An attempt to seed the device will cause an 
  exception. This defect is expected to be fixed in a future release.


Solution:

No solution is available for this issue at the present time.


Installation
------------

This release of the Teradata JDBC Driver is distributed as platform-independent 
jar files. For downloading convenience, the platform-independent jar files are 
bundled together and provided in both zip format and tar format.

TeraJDBC__indep_indep.15.10.00.22.zip and TeraJDBC__indep_indep.15.10.00.22.tar
both contain the same set of platform-independent files:

  readme.txt               - this file
  terajdbc4.jar            - the Teradata JDBC Driver
  tdgssconfig.jar          - the Teradata security configuration

Download either the zip file or the tar file, and unzip (or untar) the downloaded
file into a directory of your choice, and then set your classpath to refer to the
necessary jar files.

Your classpath must include:

  terajdbc4.jar
  tdgssconfig.jar

Your classpath must NOT include any jar files from any previous releases of
the Teradata JDBC Driver. It is recommended, but not required, that any
previous release of the Teradata JDBC Driver be uninstalled prior to
downloading and using this release of the Teradata JDBC Driver.


Documentation

Documentation for how to use the Teradata JDBC Driver is available at
